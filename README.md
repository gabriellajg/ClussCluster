# ClussCluster

This package implements a new method ClussCluster to simultaneously perform clustering analysis and signature gene selection on high-dimensional transcriptome data sets. To do so, ClussCluster incorporates a Lasso-type regularization penalty term to the objective function of K-means so that cell-type-specific signature genes can be identified while clustering the cells.

### Installing

First, we need to install and load the ClussCluster package. For each of the following sections in this vignette, we assume this step has been carried out.

```
install.packages('ClussCluster')
library(ClussCluster)
```
